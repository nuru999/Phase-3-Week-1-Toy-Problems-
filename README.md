CODE CHALLENGE README FILE;

This repository is going to illustrate for you how to solve the code challenge, this code challenges are divided into 3 parts:

CHALLENGE 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
Task: Convert a given 12-hour time to 24-hour time format. Function: convert_to_24_hour(hour, minute, period) Example: Input: convert_to_24_hour(8, 30, "am") Output: 0830

CHALLENGE 2: Two numbers are positive
Task: Determine if exactly two out of three given integers are positive numbers. Function: exactly_two_positive(a, b, c)

Challenge 3: Consonant value
Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.

#### How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Run the Python scripts containing the functions.
Modify the function parameters or test cases for different inputs.
